### Generating-Synthetic-Flight-Tracks-using-generative-adversarial-network-GAN

This project focuses on the generation of synthetic flight tracks using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) based on historical flight data from Zurich Airport. The dataset is based on runway 34 at Zurich Airport for the dates 3 October 2019 to 30 November 2019. The dataset includes information such as timestamp, altitude, callsign, and other relevant fields. The project aims to overcome the limitations of traditional simulation methods, which often rely on simplified models that may not accurately represent the complexities of real-world flight trajectories.

The proposed system architecture comprises several key components, including a data source (OpenSky Network), data storage (Amazon S3), a computational cluster, a development environment (Jupyter Notebook), and the GAN model itself. The GAN is trained on historical flight data to learn the underlying patterns and dynamics of flight trajectories, allowing it to generate diverse synthetic trajectories that closely mimic real-world behavior. The generated flight tracks can be used for various applications, including air traffic simulation, flight path optimization, and anomaly detection. The proposed system architecture leverages cloud computing and AWS services for scalability and flexibility. The workflow includes data collection, preprocessing, model training, and generation of realistic flight trajectories. Security measures such as encryption and access control ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the data. The project aims to address the scarcity of data on new technologies and procedures in air traffic management, enabling scenario forecasting and innovation in airspace design. The significance of this research lies in its potential to enhance safety and efficiency in air traffic management through the generation of realistic synthetic flight tracks.

Overall, this project aims to contribute to the field of air traffic management by providing a novel approach to generating synthetic flight tracks that can be used to improve the safety and efficiency of aviation operations.
